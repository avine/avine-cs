My Curriculum Vitae

- To build the website in the `dist/` directory, run both:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run build`

- To browse locally, run `npm run server` and go to one of the locations:
  - `/dist/index.html` for the **dev** environment (available debugging of .css and .js using sourcemaps)
  - `/dist/bundle.html` for the **prod** environment (compressed version)
